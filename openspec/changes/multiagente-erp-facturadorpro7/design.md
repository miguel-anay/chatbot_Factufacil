# Design: Multi-agent ERP co-pilot for FacturadorPro7

## Technical Approach

Additive layer over the proven hexagonal scaffold. A LangGraph supervisor routes to 5 specialist nodes (Inventario/Producto, Compras, Ventas, Logística, Contabilidad), each owning domain tools that call FacturadorPro7's real API through 8 new async ports. Irreversible/SUNAT-facing/stock writes pause via `interrupt()`. Existing `/chat`, `ChatbotService`, the 3 sync ports, FAISS/memory adapters are untouched. Formalizes `~/.claude/plans/si-hago-multiagente-lo-tingly-quilt.md` (ground truth).

## Architecture Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rejected | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hexagonal boundary | `core/domain.py` + `core/ports.py` never import LangGraph/LangChain; `core/agents/*` may (application-services layer) | Pure-core ban everywhere, or framework in domain | Agents wire domain↔LLM (`@tool`, `bind_tools`, Pydantic). Intentional documented distinction, not a leak. |
| ItemsPort sharing | `ItemsPort` (search/create, light subset) shared by Compras+Ventas for inline "create-if-missing"; `InventoryPort` owns deep catalog/stock | One mega-product port | Inline buy/sell flows need a thin product op; full maintenance (update/active/favorite/categories/brands/stock txn) is Inventario-exclusive. |
| Confirmation placement | `interrupt()` called INSIDE each write-tool body (first line, before POST) | Wrapper around node/agent execution | Only point that works identically under `create_react_agent` prebuilt (no interceptable step) and custom loop. `Command(resume=...)` continues right after `interrupt()`. |
| Credential injection | `TenantCredentials` via `config.configurable` using `InjectedToolArg`/`get_config()`; tool builds adapter per-invocation | Normal tool argument; compile-time pre-bound adapter | Graph compiled once (singleton); creds are per-request. A normal arg leaks the Bearer token into the LLM-visible JSON schema. Never in `AgentState`/checkpointer/disk/logs. |
| Multi-domain requests | No direct edges between specialists; no auto-chaining in v1 | Auto Compras→Logística chain | Chaining auto-writes multiplies blast radius of one human confirmation. Specialist suggests next step as a fresh user turn. Deferred "plan mode". |
| Port sync/async split | 8 new ports async; 3 existing ports stay sync | Convert all to async | New ports do real remote I/O; existing path has no regression need. Intentional scoped split. |
| Routing | `context_module` fast-path (no LLM) + `.with_structured_output()` fallback over a `Literal` of 5 modules | LLM-always routing | Frontend already knows the module; skip a call when hinted. |
| Lifespan failure isolation | Agent graph compilation wrapped in `try/except` inside the EXISTING `lifespan()` in `main.py`, after the existing `chatbot = ChatbotService(...)` line. On failure: `app.state.agent_graph = None`, `app.state.agent_error = str(exc)`, log, do NOT re-raise. `agent_router.py` endpoints check `app.state.agent_graph is None` → `503`. `/health` surfaces `agent_error` | Letting graph compilation exceptions propagate out of `lifespan()` | `lifespan()` is a single shared FastAPI startup hook — an uncaught exception anywhere in it fails `yield` and takes down the WHOLE app, including the unrelated existing `/chat` path. Hexagonal isolation is code-level, not process-level; this is the actual mechanism that prevents a broken new agent from killing a working old endpoint. MANDATORY for the PR that touches `main.py` (entrypoint wiring phase) — not optional polish. |
| New-dependency pinning | `langgraph`, `langchain-core`, `langchain-openai`, `httpx` pinned to the EXACT versions proven in the Phase 0 smoke test (`==`, not `>=`/ranges) when added to `requirements.txt` | Loose ranges (`>=X,<Y`) | A range lets `pip` resolve a version never tested, which can break `docker build` or install incompatible transitive deps — discovered only at deploy time without a CI build gate. Exact pin removes that variable; existing loose ranges (`langchain-core>=0.2.0` etc.) are a pre-existing latent version of this same risk, not introduced by this change. |

## Data Flow

    POST /agent/chat (msg, session_id, context_module, creds)
      → graph.invoke(state, config={"configurable": {creds, thread_id=session_id}})
        → supervisor: context_module fast-path | structured-output fallback
          → specialist node (bind_tools): read tools run; write tool → interrupt()
            ↳ pauses → /agent/chat returns {status: "awaiting_confirmation", confirmation}
    POST /agent/confirm (session_id, approved)
      → graph.invoke(Command(resume={"approved": approved}), same thread_id)
        → tool continues after interrupt(): builds adapter from creds → real POST → END

Specialists never edge to each other; all paths terminate at `END`.

```

`AgentState` (TypedDict): `messages` (`add_messages`), `context_module`, `active_specialist`, `session_id`, `pending_confirmation`, `handoff_reason`. Credentials NEVER in state.

HTTP: `/agent/chat` → `{session_id, status: answered|awaiting_confirmation, answer?, confirmation?:{tool_name, summary, tool_args}}`. `/agent/confirm` → resume via `Command(resume={"approved": bool})` on `thread_id=session_id`. Dev checkpointer: `InMemorySaver`.

## Testing Strategy

| Layer | What | Approach |
|---|---|---|
| Smoke (gate) | qwen-plus tool_calls + async `interrupt()` cycle | Echo tool bind + trivial interrupt → resume, BEFORE building ~25 tools |
| Unit | Each tool/adapter schema | Pydantic schema, creds-injection path, no token in serialized schema |
| Integration | Each adapter vs `desa.facturadorpro7.test` | Real login/token before wrapping in a tool |
| E2E | Per specialist propose→`awaiting_confirmation`→`/agent/confirm`→real write | Verify doc created in ERP; routing for 5 `context_module` values + fallback |
| Regression | `/chat` unchanged | Pre-sales bot zero regression |

## Migration / Rollout

Purely additive. Rollback = remove `include_router` in `main.py`; new folders deletable with no impact. Before real users: migrate `InMemorySaver` → `langgraph-checkpoint-sqlite`/`-postgres` (pending confirmation lost on restart otherwise).

**CI gate (implemented, applies to every PR in this chain, not just this change)**: `deploy.yml` now has a `test` job (`docker build` → boot container → poll `/health` up to 90s, first boot loads the embedding model and takes ~50s → run `test_chatbot.py`) that `deploy` depends on via `needs: test`. A broken build or a regression on `/chat` blocks the SSM deploy automatically — this is what actually prevents production breakage; hexagonal/SDD reduce blast radius and ambiguity but don't execute code. Requires a GitHub Actions repo secret `ALIBABA_API_KEY` (separate from the existing AWS SSM parameter used at deploy time) for the regression-test step to get real LLM responses — not yet provisioned, pending user action (`gh secret set ALIBABA_API_KEY`).

## Open Questions

- [x] qwen-plus tool-calling + async `interrupt()` — RESOLVED in Phase 0: passed both checks first try, no model swap needed.
- [ ] `/api/retentions`, `/api/perceptions` schemas — PARTIALLY INVESTIGATED in Phase 2 (live sandbox, real 500s not 422s — validation never reached): BOTH require an undocumented nested `datos_del_emisor` (issuer data) structure absent entirely from openapi.yaml, traced 2 levels deep into Laravel transform classes (`RetentionTransform.php` -> `EstablishmentTransform.php` -> still-undiscovered `datos_del_proveedor`) before being time-boxed to avoid excessive trial-and-error POSTs against a shared tenant. STILL UNRESOLVED — needs direct controller source read (`app/CoreFacturalo/Requests/Api/Transform/RetentionTransform.php`/`PerceptionTransform.php`) before Phase 3 tool schemas can be finalized for `crear_retencion`/`crear_percepcion`.
- [ ] `/api/dispatches` required fields — INVESTIGATED in Phase 2: same `datos_del_emisor` nested-structure gap as retentions/perceptions (a shared transform pattern across this Laravel app's SUNAT-document endpoints). `extra: dict` escape remains the mitigation in `dispatch_adapter.py`; the schema itself is NOT yet discovered. STILL UNRESOLVED.
- [x] `/api/cash/open` required fields — RESOLVED in Phase 2 via real 422 against sandbox: only `beginning_balance` is actually required. `date_opening`/`time_opening` are NOT required server-side (contradicts the original assumption). Also discovered: `/api/cash/close/{cash}` is a GET route in the real spec/app, not POST as design.md originally assumed.
- [ ] Stock transfer between warehouses (`/api/transfers/*`) not in spec — deferred, NOT built; `register_transaction` covers simple in/out only.
- [ ] NEW (Phase 2 discovery): `register_transaction`'s `inventory_transaction_id` is a tenant-configured foreign key (e.g. id=10/11 = valid "ingreso" types on the sandbox tenant) with NO listing endpoint anywhere in openapi.yaml. The tools/agents layer (Phase 3+) cannot safely hardcode these IDs across tenants — needs either a documented lookup endpoint or per-tenant configuration resolved at runtime before `registrar_movimiento_stock` ships.
- [ ] NEW (Phase 2 discovery): `create_sale_note()`/`create_purchase()` real attempts against the sandbox both hit genuine server-side data/schema gaps unrelated to the adapter's request shape (a missing `series.prefix` config for sale notes; an undocumented NOT-NULL `purchase_items.item` snapshot column for purchases). Both are flagged, not silently patched — Phase 3 tool design should account for the possibility that `crear_preliminar_venta`/`crear_compra` may surface 500-class errors from causes outside the agent's control on some tenants.
